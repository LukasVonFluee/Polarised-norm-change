Polarised norm change simulation

Steps to follow:

1) Copy/download repository in a directory on your personal computer: Open as R project with the file "homophily.Rproj" to have automatic setting of working directory.

2) First execute the simulation with sim.R. The output of the simulation should then automatically be stored in the working directory.

3) Execute plots.R to produce the plots. For this, the working directory needs to be set to where the output of the simulation is. If the previous steps worked, this should work automatically.
